A simple tool to edit markdown files in OneDrive online. 

I prefer to write notes in markdown files and save them in OneDrive locally. But sometimes I need to access those markdown files online when OneDrive is not available locally. That's why I create this small app.

BTW, OneDrive online now supports editing files online, but with limited preview feature.

## Getting started
